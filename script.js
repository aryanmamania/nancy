If you’re feeling mentally exhausted, low, or like nothing feels right anymore, it’s okay. You don’t always have to be strong. It’s okay to take a break, to feel tired, and to have difficult days.

Please don’t blame yourself for what you’re feeling. Your feelings are real and valid, and you matter more than you may realize. You don’t have to explain everything to anyone or pretend that you’re okay. Life can get really difficult sometimes, and honestly, I regret so much that I’m not there with you during this difficult time. I wish I could be there for you right now.

Things may feel really difficult today, but that doesn’t mean they will always feel this way. I hate seeing you cry, and I think you know that by now. The last time I saw you cry in front of me was when your mom threw away your flowers. I still remember it.

Please take care of yourself, and remember that you are not alone. Whenever you need someone, you can call or message me. I’ll be here.

And please, apna haq samjho—if you need anything, just tell me. Itna dimaag mat lagao, yaar. You’ve known me for five years, and even after all these years, so many twists and turns have come into this story. I know maybe all of this feels normal to you because you’ve been living through it, but for me? It’s not normal at all.

You are that one person for me who is different. You matter to me in a way I probably can’t properly explain. So please, don’t ever feel like you have to deal with everything by yourself. If you need me, just say it. I’m always here.
